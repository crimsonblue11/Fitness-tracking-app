# Fitness Tracking App

This app is designed to track a user's walking, cycling, and running habits, using a variety of location-based features.

This app was written for my MDP (Mobile Development) final coursework as part of my Computer Science degree, in which I achieved a 60% overall. 

This app was written in Java using Android Studio, with layouts written in XML.
